		<h1>Perihelion distance</h1>
		<p><span class="bold">Apsis</span> (Greek: ἁψίς; plural <span class="bold">apsides</span> /ˈæpsɪdiːz/, Greek: ἁψῖδες; "orbit") denotes either of the two extreme points (i.e., the farthest or nearest point) in the orbit of a planetary body about its primary body (or simply, "the primary"). The plural term, "apsides," usually implies both apsis points (i.e., farthest and nearest); apsides can also refer to the distance of the extreme range of an object orbiting a host body. For example, the apsides of Earth's orbit of the Sun are two: the <span class="italic">apsis</span> for Earth's farthest point from the Sun, dubbed the <span class="bold">aphelion</span>; and the <span class="italic">apsia</span> for Earth's nearest point, the <span class="bold">perihelion</span>. (The term "apsis", a cognate with <span class="italic">apse</span>, comes via Latin from Greek).</p>
		<p>The <span class="bold">Perihelion distance</span> is the distance between baricenter and the perihelion.</p>
