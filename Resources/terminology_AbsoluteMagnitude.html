		<h1>Absolute magnitude, H</h1>
		<p><span class="bold">Absolute magnitude <span class="italic">(M)</span></span> is a measure of the luminosity of a celestial object, on an inverse logarithmic astronomical magnitude scale. An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the apparent magnitude that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10.0 parsecs (32.6 light-years), without extinction (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by interstellar matter and cosmic dust. By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale.</p>
		<p>As with all astronomical magnitudes, the absolute magnitude can be specified for different wavelength ranges corresponding to specified filter bands or passbands; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the <span class="bold">absolute visual magnitude</span>, which uses the visual (V) band of the spectrum (in the UBV photometric system). Absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital M, with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement, such as M<span class="sub">V</span> for absolute magnitude in the V band.</p>
		<p>The more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude. A difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities, and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100<span class="sup">(n/5)</span>. For example, a star of absolute magnitude M<span class="sub">V</span>=3.0 would be 100 times more luminous than a star of absolute magnitude M<span class="sub">V</span>=8.0 as measured in the V filter band. The Sun has absolute magnitude M<span class="sup">V</span>=+4.83. Highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes: for example, the Milky Way galaxy has an absolute B magnitude of about -20.8.</p>
		<p>An object's absolute <span class="italic">bolometric</span> magnitude (M<span class="sub">bol</span>) represents its total luminosity over all wavelengths, rather than in a single filter band, as expressed on a logarithmic magnitude scale. To convert from an absolute magnitude in a specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude, a bolometric correction (BC) is applied.</p>
		<p>For Solar System bodies that shine in reflected light, a different definition of absolute magnitude (H) is used, based on a standard reference distance of one astronomical unit.</p>
