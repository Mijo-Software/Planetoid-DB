  	<h1>Mean anomaly at the epoch, in degrees</h1>
		<p>In celestial mechanics, the <span class="bold">mean anomaly</span> is the fraction of an elliptical orbit's period that has elapsed since the orbiting body passed periapsis, expressed as an angle which can be used in calculating the position of that body in the classical two-body problem. It is the angular distance from the pericenter which a fictitious body would have if it moved in a circular orbit, with constant speed, in the same orbital period as the actual body in its elliptical orbit.</p>
