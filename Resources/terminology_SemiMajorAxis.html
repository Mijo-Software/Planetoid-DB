		<h1>Semimajor axis (AU)</h1>
		<p>In geometry, the major axis of an ellipse is its longest diameter: a line segment that runs through the center and both foci, with ends at the widest points of the perimeter.</p>
		<p>The <span class="bold">semi-major axis</span> (more properly, <span class="bold">major semi-axis</span>) is one half of the major axis, and thus runs from the centre, through a focus, and to the perimeter. The <span class="bold">semi-minor axis</span> (more properly, <span class="bold">minor semi-axis</span>) of an ellipse or hyperbola is a line segment that is at right angles with the semi-major axis and has one end at the center of the conic section. For the special case of a circle, the lengths of the semi-axes are both equal to the radius of the circle.</p>
		<p>The length of the semi-major axis <span class="italic">a</span> of an ellipse is related to the semi-minor axis's length <span class="italic">b</span> through the eccentricity e and the semi-latus rectum <span class="italic">l</span>.</p>
