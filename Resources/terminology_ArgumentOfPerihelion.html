		<h1>Argument of perihelion, J2000.0 (degrees)</h1>
		<p>The <span class="bold">argument of periapsis</span> (also called <span class="bold">argument of perifocus</span> or <span class="bold">argument of pericenter</span>), symbolized as <<span class="italic">ω</span>, is one of the orbital elements of an orbiting body. Parametrically, <span class="italic">ω</span> is the angle from the body's ascending node to its periapsis, measured in the direction of motion.</p>
		<p>For specific types of orbits, words such as <span class="bold">perihelion</span> (for heliocentric orbits), <span class="bold">perigee</span> (for geocentric orbits), <span class="bold">periastron</span> (for orbits around stars), and so on may replace the word <span class="bold">periapsis</span>.</p>
		<p>An argument of periapsis of 0° means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from South to North. An argument of periapsis of 90° means that the orbiting body will reach periapsis at its northmost distance from the plane of reference.</p>
		<p>Adding the argument of periapsis to the longitude of the ascending node gives the longitude of the periapsis. However, especially in discussions of binary stars and exoplanets, the terms "longitude of periapsis" or "longitude of periastron" are often used synonymously with "argument of periapsis".</p>
